This project was created for the programming course at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
This game is a clone of well-known arcade game named Tetris. The aim in Tetris is simple: last as long as you can.
You bring down blocks from the top of the screen.
You can move the blocks around,
either left to right and/or you can rotate them.
Your objective is to get all the blocks  to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen.
Whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
